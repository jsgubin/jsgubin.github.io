== About me
Bin Gu received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the [http://iao.nuaa.edu.cn/ Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics], Nanjing, China, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

Dr. Gu currently is an assistant professor of department of machine learning in Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence. He is also an adjunct professor of [https://www.uwo.ca/ Western University]. Before joining MBZUAI, he was a full professor of [https://en.nuist.edu.cn/, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology]. He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the [https://www.uwo.ca/ University of Western Ontario], London, ON, Canada, from Feb. 2013 to Feb. 2015. He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the [https://www.uta.edu/ University of Texas at Arlington], from Aug. 2016 to Aug. 2017. He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the [https://www.pitt.edu/ University of Pittsburgh] from Sep. 2017 to July. 2018.
